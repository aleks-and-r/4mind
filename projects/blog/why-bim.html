          <p class="paragraph-subtitle">FIRST, TELL US WHAT IS BIM TECHNOLOGY FOR YOU? </p>
          <p>BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology is, in my opinion, primarily in our architectural work, an
            unavoidable platform. It is a platform that primarily unites all participants in the entire construction
            process, in an interactive way, reducing the possibility of errors during that process.
          <p> Due to the increasingly pronounced demands of clients for the shortest possible deadlines of a project
            documentation alongside with inevitable changes during design, it is simply impossible to imagine project
            documentation that is fully harmonized with each other, and still work in the old traditional way.
          <p> BIM is becoming imperative, as the only correct way to approach design and an adequate response to the
            time we are currently working on, and especially the time yet to come.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="paragraph-subtitle">WHEN DID YOU FIRST MEET THE BIM DESIGN TECNOLOGY IN THE PRACTICE? </p>
          <p>Honestly, I met BIM technology, or more precisely programs that work on the principle of BIM, a long time
            ago, back in 2002, while staying at the construction fair in Bologna.
          <p>I spent a few days, during a visit to that fair, listening and watching program presentations that work on
            the BIM platform. I have to admit, I felt back then, that it is a technology that provides completely new
            possibilities in the entire design process.
          <p>As an architect-designer, I dreamed of having an adequate program that allows me significant speed of
            changes and decision-making during the design process, without implying "mining" work of harmonizing models
            and technical documentation that is the end result of that process. BIM programs provide that interactive
            alignment.
          </p>
          <p>And here we are eighteen years, since I became infected with BIM technology, without which I would not be
            able to imagine working in any architectural environment.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="paragraph-subtitle">WHAT IS THE BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BIM AND THE TRADITIONAL BUREAU SETTING?
          </p>
          <p>The difference is huge. It is reflected in the first place, in the speed and accuracy of the technical
            documentation. The information contained in one BIM model can be used in various fields and projects of
            other professions that participate in the process of designing a facility.</p>
          <p>By changing this information due to adjustments, which are an integral part of every design process, the
            information in the final technical documentation changes interactively and automatically, which is the basis
            on which the facilities are built. Compliance is current and does not require additional alteration.</p>
          <p>One of the most picturesque examples are the tables with realized surfaces which are an integral part of
            every architectural project. By changing the geometry of some rooms, the parameters of the surface or
            processing material in the indicated tables for those rooms, as well as their final sums, are automatically
            changed. This is just one of many examples, which, compared to the traditional way of designing, speeds up
            the process and reduces the possibility of error to a minimum.
          </p>
          <p>And here we are eighteen years, since I became infected with BIM technology, without which I would not be
            able to imagine working in any architectural environment.

          <p class="paragraph-subtitle">HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOUNG ARCHITECTS IN SERBIA HAVE EXPERIENCE IN WORKING IN
            THE BIM SYSTEM? </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I must admit that our environment is again significantly lagging behind world trends.
            Throughout this period of eighteen years, since I started working in one of the BIM programs, I have had a
            hard time finding associates who were willing to master BIM in the right way. They were especially difficult
            to find among young architects.</p>
          <p>In the last two years, there has been a noticeable shift in interest in BIM programs, as a consequence of
            the arrival of many foreign design companies in our area, but only as an imperative for employment in these
            companies.</p>
          <p>Access to BIM programs is still the same as traditional modeling programs. BIM programs, unfortunately, are
            not just a modeling tool, but significantly much, much more.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="paragraph-subtitle">WHICH PROGRAM WOULD YOU CHOOSE?</p>
          <p>I mentioned that I met BIM programs back in 2002 at the fair in Bologna. Then in a few days, I was
            following the presentations of Revit_ver4.5 which was just then purchased by Autodesk, as well as
            ArchiCAD_ver8.5 developed by Graphisoft.</p>
          <p>Like everyone at the time, I used AutoCAD and 3DMax, the flagships of Autodesk, so the logical choice was
            to choose Revit. I have to admit, switching from AutoCAD to Revit as much as it had comparative advantages,
            wasn’t that easy.</p>
          <p>Coincidentally, a younger colleague who was looking for a job in my studio knew the program ArchiCAD. In
            that way, I had a unique opportunity to compare the work of one architect in the Revit or ArchiCAD program
            at the same time. I have noticed, in my humble opinion, that ArchiCAD is more significantly tailored to us
            architects in terms of many things and the choice has finally fallen on ArchiCAD. From there on, I have been
            an active user of ArchiCAD more than seventeen years.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="paragraph-subtitle">WHY DO ARCHITECTURAL OFFICES DEVIATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BIM IN THE WORK
            SYSTEM?</p>
          <p>They have a resistance, because BIM implies abandoning old habits in designing and new learning. It is
            simply difficult for people to decide that it is necessary to renew knowledge with new technologies and
            world tendencies. Learning something new is not an easy choice and so with a line of less resistance they
            opt for the standard approach, regardless of the fact that BIM brings significant acceleration.</p>
          <p>Many studios, in fact, do not see how BIM actually becomes indispensable if they want their office to
            survive in the very near future.</p>
          <p>An example of such short-sightedness, we have the example of Nokia, which simply did not see the future of
            touch phones and ignoring this information, in a very short period of time from the world's leading mobile
            phone company, became a company with a minority share in the world market. They just didn’t know how to
            adjust to the new coming time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="paragraph-subtitle">... AND IN THE END, WHY BIM?
          </p>
          <p>The BIM (Bulding Information Model) is simply a necessary tool in the times we live and work. Modern
            tendencies tell us that there is an even more significant acceleration in the near future, so that work
            without BIM programs will not be simply possible.
          </p>
          <p>Imagine this world of ours as the fastest mountain creek in which we all find ourselves. In order to stay
            afloat, it is necessary to swim. If by any chance, we stop swimming and just stay afloat, the inevitably
            fast mountain flow of the river will take us miles downstream.
          </p>
          <p>All those who use BIM are those who swim opposite the creek, and those who do not use it are miles
            downstream. THE DECISION IS UP TO US WHERE WE WANT TO BE.
